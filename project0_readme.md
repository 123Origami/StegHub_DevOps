# LAMP Stack Setup with Apache Virtual Host

## üìå Project Overview
This project covers the installation and configuration of a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on an Ubuntu server.  
We will also configure a virtual host for a website and enable PHP on it.

---
## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

1. **An AWS Account**  
   - You‚Äôll need access to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) to create and manage your EC2 instance.  

2. **An EC2 Instance (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)**  
   - Minimum: t2.micro (Free Tier eligible) with 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM.  
   - Security group configured to allow:  
     - **SSH** (port 22) ‚Äî for remote terminal access.  
     - **HTTP** (port 80) ‚Äî for web traffic.  
     - **HTTPS** (port 443) ‚Äî optional, for secure web traffic.  

3. **SSH Key Pair**  
   - Downloaded when creating your EC2 instance.  
   - Keep it safe ‚Äî it‚Äôs your login credential.

4. **Basic Terminal Knowledge**  
   - Ability to navigate the terminal and run commands like `cd`, `ls`, `sudo`.  

5. **Local Machine Requirements**  
   - A terminal (Linux/Mac) or **PowerShell**/**WSL** (Windows).  
   - **SSH client** installed (most systems have it by default).  

6. **Text Editor**  
   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any preferred editor for editing configuration files.  

7. **Stable Internet Connection**  
   - For installing packages and accessing your server remotely.

## üîí Optional Security Best Practices

While setting up your EC2 instance, consider these extra steps to keep your server secure ‚Äî especially if you plan to share it for demonstration purposes:

1. **Limit Access by IP**  
   - In your security group, allow SSH (port 22) access **only** from your own IP address.  
   - This prevents unauthorized login attempts from the internet.

2. **Use a Non-Default SSH Port** *(Optional)*  
   - Changing the SSH port from `22` to another number can reduce automated bot scans.  
   - Update your `sshd_config` file and restart the SSH service.

3. **Disable Root Login via SSH**  
   - Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to set `PermitRootLogin no`.  
   - Use a regular user with `sudo` privileges instead.

4. **Turn Off the Instance When Not in Use**  
   - Saves cost and prevents exposure when you‚Äôre not actively working on the server.  

5. **Use HTTPS for Web Pages**  
   - Set up a free SSL certificate using [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to secure your web traffic.  

6. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets in Public Repos**  
   - Never commit passwords, private keys, or sensitive data to GitHub.  
   - Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.

7. **Regularly Update Your Server**  
   - Run:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```  
     to patch security vulnerabilities.


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ System Update 

### Commands Used
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
````

### Notes

* Keeps the server packages up to date before installing new software.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Apache

### Commands Used

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

**Screenshot:**

![Apache Installed](screenshots/apache_installed.png)

*Confirmed that the installation was successful

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Firewall for Apache

### Commands Used

* No commands were used for this step, instead I went to the security options and updated my security group to allow for SSH connections on TCP port 22 and HTTP transfers on port 80 from my IP

**Screenshot:**
![Firewall Configuration](screenshots/firewall_apache.png)


* Confirmed that the server was locally accesible using the curl command
### Commands Used
```bash
curl http://localhost:80

```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install MySQL

### Commands Used

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

```

**Screenshot:**

![MySQL Installed](screenshots/mysql_installed.png)

* When the installation is completed one can login to the mysql console using 
```bash
sudo mysql
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure MySQL Installation

### Commands Used

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation

```

**Screenshot:**
![MySQL Secure](screenshots/mysql_secure.png)

What It Does:
The mysql_secure_installation script helps improve the security of your database server by:

Setting a root password ‚Äì Protects your root account.

Removing anonymous users ‚Äì Prevents access without a username.

Disabling remote root login ‚Äì Stops root from logging in over the network.

Removing test database ‚Äì Eliminates an insecure default database.

Reloading privilege tables ‚Äì Applies changes immediately.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Install PHP

### Commands Used

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y
php -v
```

**Screenshot:**
![PHP Installed](screenshots/php_installed.png)

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Create Apache Virtual Host

### Commands Used

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/mywebsite
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/mywebsite
```

**Create Virtual Host Config File**

```bash
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/mywebsite.conf
```

Example content:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerName mywebsite.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/mywebsite
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Enable Virtual Host**

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
sudo a2ensite mywebsite.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```
**Creating an index.html file to run**
* Run the following command to create an index.html file as the default landing page

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" -s) && \
echo "Hello LAMP2 from $(curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ho
stname) with public IP $(curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ip
v4)" | \
sudo tee /var/www/mywebsite/index.html
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Enable PHP on Website
**Edit directory index**
* Open the dir.conf file
```bash
sudo vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```
* Change the order so that index.php comes first
* Default settings look like:
```bash
DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm

```
* Update it to: 
```bash
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm

```
* Save and exit

**Restart Apache**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**Test PHP**
* Create a new file called index.php inside your root web folder

```bash
vim /var/www/mywebsite/index.php
```
* This will open a blank file, enter the following code on it and save

```bash
<?php
phpinfo();
```
* If you refresh the page after saving and closing you will see a page similar to the one below



**Screenshot:**
![PHP Info Page](screenshots/php_info.png)

* It is advisable to delete this page after you are done as it reveals a lot of sensitive information about your system. You can always recreate it if you need to find out more information about your server and php configuration

## üõ† Easy Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while running or connecting to your EC2-hosted project, try these quick fixes:

1. **Server Not Loading in Browser**
   - Make sure your EC2 instance is **running** in the AWS Console.
   - Check that the correct **inbound rules** (HTTP/HTTPS) are open in your Security Group.

2. **Cannot SSH into EC2 Instance**
   - Verify you‚Äôre using the correct `.pem` key file and correct **username** (`ec2-user`, `ubuntu`, etc.).
   - Ensure port **22** is open in your Security Group.
   - Check if your IP address has changed ‚Äî update the Security Group rule if needed.

3. **Website Works Locally but Not on EC2**
   - Ensure your application is listening on `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
   - Restart the service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart <your-service-name>
     ```

4. **Changes Not Appearing**
   - Clear your browser cache or try in **incognito mode**.
   - Restart your web server:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart apache2   # For Apache
     sudo systemctl restart nginx     # For Nginx
     ```

5. **High Costs or Unexpected Charges**
   - Stop your instance when you‚Äôre not using it.
   - Delete unused EBS volumes, snapshots, or Elastic IPs.

6. **EC2 Instance Feels Slow**
   - Check CPU and memory usage:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
   - Upgrade to a larger instance type if needed.
